// This schema defines the structure for the collection to store possible guides. 
// That is, this collection stores guides that have been proposed but not yet approved. 
// From a formatting standpoint, it should be basically the same as the actual guides model, since data will be passed from this to that.  

// Require mongoose
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
// Create Schema class
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

  // MongoDB appears to just store everything as string types??
