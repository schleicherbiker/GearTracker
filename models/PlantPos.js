// This schema defines the structure for the collection to store possible plants. 
// That is, this collection stores plants that have been proposed but not yet approved. 
// From a formatting standpoint, it should be basically the same as the actual plants model, since data will be passed from this to that.  
// Our current outline does not allow users to propose new categories and therefore the childPlants field is not required. 
// I left it in, however, in case we want to add that feature in the future. 

// I'm being liberal on leaving categories in this model for now, but when we get further along we should refactor it based on what we're actually using. 


// Require mongoose
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
// Create Schema class
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

// Create schema
var PlantPosSchema = new Schema({
  // The only required value is the title. 
  // It should be used both for plant detail information and category information.

  // Again, it is my understanding that MongoDB stores longer text as still just strings as opposed to text blobs. 
  // I'm not completly confident about that, however, so if we have problems I'll do more research. 

  // Enum part of this model has not been tested yet.
  // 'Easy' and 'Difficult' are legacy and can be removed before going to production version.

  difficulty: {

  // Child plants should recieve an array. 
  // The array should store MongoDB IDs (from this table) of each child plant in the given category.

// Create the model with the schema
