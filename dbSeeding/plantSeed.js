The roots send up an abundant amount of shoots, called canes. Keep order by pruning away the majority of them, so that the survivors can produce lots of berries.",
            "Red raspberries: Prune any time after the last harvest and before growth begins in the spring. Cut all canes that produced fruit to the ground. Thin to 6 sturdy canes per hill (per foot of row).",
            "Black and purple raspberries: When primocanes are between 24 to 30 inches in height, pinch out the tip of each shoot to induce branching. This will make the fruit easier to pick and increase production. After harvest, cut down all canes that bore fruit to ground level.",
            "Ever-bearing or fall-bearing raspberries: Cut all canes to the ground any time after harvest and before growth begins in the spring. Mow them to the ground or use pruning shears for a small patch.",
            "All varieties will begin to produce fruit in their second season. In some cases, ever-bearers may bear small berries in their first autumn. In early summer, berries will ripen over a time of about 2 weeks. You will need to pick berries every couple of days. Try to harvest berries on a sunny day, when they are dry. Don’t tug too hard on your raspberries when picking. A ripe raspberry will leave the vine willingly."],
