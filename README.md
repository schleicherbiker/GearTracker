# Gardyn

Gardyn.org is a web app to help beginner gardeners get up and running with their first garden. The initial version focuses on common and relatively easy to grow fruits and veggies such as tomatoes, peas and strawberries. 

Like Sparknotes for gardeners, our app will give you the need-to-know information in a quick and easy to read format.
